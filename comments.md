# Comments on Onboarding Challenges

## 1. What is this?

It's a bit unclear what the product of this exercise should be. A doc? A script? I used a Jupyter notebook so I could include notes and runnable commands.

The instructions say to describe the contents, purpose, etc "for each file". But this seems like overkill.

## 2. When given ___, show us ___

This challenge was pretty clear. I noticed that the instructions don't point to which specific files should be used for each task. I guess figuring out what data you need is part of the challenge.

For some tasks, e.g. computing connectomes, you just ask for a computed result.
Maybe the instructions could be more specific to ask for a *figure* visualizing the computed result. This is minor though.
